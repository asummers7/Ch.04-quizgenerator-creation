# QuizGenerator-Creation 

## Description
This project we started from a bare template. We were tasked to create an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file with our own code. The goal of the project was to have a quiz generator that allowed the user to complete a small quiz. The scores of the user were to be recorded and then if the user wanted to, they would also have the option of recalling their saved scores. Similarly the user would be able to delete their scores from the saved list if they wanted to. This project also implemented to the user of a timer. If a question is answered incorrectly the timer would be deducted by a given amount. If the user is to run out of time the quiz would be over and user must start over.
